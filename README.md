## Txt Creator
Warning: This code is poorly commented and not yet fully functional!
## Creating different size .txt files
In the final line of the python script, TxtCreator() takes two arguments.
For example: TxtCreator(64,128).main() will generate .txt files with line-length = 64 and number-of-lines = 128 (plus a newline character at the end)
